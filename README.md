# Assignment-1 : Climate Change

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most fiercely debated scientific issues of the past 20 years. Human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.Climate change fatalities are generally linked to four different catalysts:
-Rising temperatures
-Declining air quality
-Extreme weather
-Vector-borne illnesses
In this assignment I am concentrating on the reason for Rising Temperature. For which, I have taken climate change data to visualize the temerature variation through Pandas,NumPy,MathPlotlib & Linear Regression.
## Climate Change - Preparing Data
This data is chosen from https://www.kaggle.com/vageeshabudanur/riseintemp-dataset

The file climate_change.csv contains climate data from May 1983 to December 2008. The available variables include:

parameters are Year ,Month, MEI, CO2,CH4,N2O,CFC-11,CFC-12,TSI,Aerosols,Temp.But for performing linear regression we are just doing with two parameters years vs. temperature rising.

## Linear Regression Model
The aim of linear regression is to model a continuous variable y as a mathematical function of one or more x variable(s), so that we can use this regression model to predict the y when only the x is known. This mathematical equation can be generalized as follows:
```y=a+bx+Ïµ```

We can make interactive plot Python library Matplotlib.
