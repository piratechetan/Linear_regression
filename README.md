# Assignment-1 : Climate Change

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most fiercely debated scientific issues of the past 20 years. Human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.Climate change fatalities are generally linked to four different catalysts:
-Rising temperatures
-Declining air quality
-Extreme weather
-Vector-borne illnesses
In this assignment I am concentrating on the reason for Rising Temperature. For which, I have taken climate change data to visualize the temerature variation through Pandas,NumPy,MathPlotlib & Linear Regression
